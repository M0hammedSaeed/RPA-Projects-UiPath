Snowstorms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls.  Snowstorms automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights.  Creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Fort save or be blown away (Tiny or smaller creatures; knocked prone and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet), knocked down (Small; prone), or checked (Medium; unable to move forward against the force of the wind).  Airborne creatures are instead blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and dealt 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting (Small or smaller creatures), blown back 1d6 x 10 feet (Medium), or blown back 1d6 x 5 feet (Large).  In addition, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square.\n  Severe Cold: In conditions of severe cold or exposure (below 0°F), an unprotected character must make a Fortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage on each failed save.  A character who has the Survival skill may receive a bonus on her saving throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well. Characters wearing winter clothing only need check once per hour for cold and exposure damage.  A character who takes any nonlethal damage from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as fatigued). These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the cold and exposure.  Nonlethal damage from cold or exposure cannot be recovered until the character gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once a character is rendered unconscious through the accumulation of nonlethal damage, the cold and exposure begins to deal lethal damage at the same rate."}}]}}
