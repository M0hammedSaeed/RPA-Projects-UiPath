| Project Name | Description | Demo Video | Repo Link | 
|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Random Weather Generator** | This RPA (Robotic Process Automation) project automates the process of generating random weather data based on user-defined criteria, extracting relevant information, and saving it into a structured text file within the project directory. The bot will interact with a random weather data generator, retrieve data such as temperature (High, Low, Relative), Wind (Force, speed), and mor information, and store it locally and log it. | [View](https://youtu.be/nxPtOnRx7Z4) | [Link](/Random%20Weather%20Generator) <br> [Modern](/Random%20Weather%20Generator%20(Modern)) |
