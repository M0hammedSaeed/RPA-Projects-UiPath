## üìÇ Projects

| Project Name | Description | Demo Video | Repo Link | 
|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Udemy Search By Course Name** | This bot is designed to search for a specific course on Udemy based on user input. Using UiPath, it navigates to the Udemy website, enters the course name, and extracts the course name, rating, cost, and author details for the first three courses that appear in the search results. After collecting the data, the bot identifies and prints the course with the lowest cost. If two or more courses have the same lowest cost, it prints all of them. | [View](https://youtu.be/L3xhdRFonPc) | [Link](/Udemy%20Search%20By%20Course%20Name) |
| **Random Weather Generator** | This RPA (Robotic Process Automation) project automates the process of generating random weather data based on user-defined criteria, extracting relevant information, and saving it into a structured text file within the project directory. The bot will interact with a random weather data generator, retrieve data such as temperature (High, Low, Relative), Wind (Force, speed), and mor information, and store it locally and log it. | [View](https://youtu.be/nxPtOnRx7Z4) | [Classic](/Random%20Weather%20Generator) <br> [Modern](/Random%20Weather%20Generator%20(Modern)) |
| **Corona Virus Worldometer** | Automate the extraction of COVID-19 statistics (Cases, Deaths, Recovered) for a user-input country from the "Coronavirus Worldometer" website and display the results in an output log. | [View](https://youtu.be/XqKEW6Bv-m8) | [Classic](/Corona%20Virus%20Worldometer) <br> [Modern](/Corona%20Virus%20Worldometer%20(Modern)) |
